# CS210_Cplusplus
*Hello! This is Jasmine Procaccini from CS-210-11576-M01. I already have a personal Github account, so I just created the repository on here*
*Please let me know if it needs to be through the school account and I will update it right away. Thanks!*
**************************************************************************************************************************************
*Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.*
  This project was creating a program to track sales of specefic items for a grocery store. There are options to search for specefic items, or simply view data of all the daily sales.
  
*What did you do particularly well?*
  I think that I used comments well in this code! I've struggled with not putting enough comments in the past, but I made sure to include      lots on this project. Also, creating a map- it wasn't something we practiced previously in this course, but I found it very helpful!
  
*Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?*
  I think that I need to work on using multiple files rather than storing everything in the main file. Also, I want to practice using          classes more- I feel comfortable creating them, but I rarely actually utilize them.
  
*Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?*
  I found the map quite challenging to create. It was mentioned in the post guidelines, but we haven't actually covered them in class. I       scrolled through the optional Zybooks lessons and found some information, which was very helpful. I also googled some information and        examples of maps (w3 Schools is a great free site I found with a dictionary of various C++ terms!), so that was very helpful.

*What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?*
  Tracking data like this, a string with a number, is something that could be applicaple in many situations. I'm not very happy woth my        code, honestly (I think it definitely could've been more complex, maybe use more fail-safes and class application), but I think it's good    practice and makes a good jumping off point for future endeavors. Honestly, I think I might come back and rework this in the future just     for my own gratification. I do think I did a pretty good job of making it adaptable and readable, though, using lots of commments and        formatting it well.
